            </div>
            <div class="program-desc">
                <p> CS Chicas, is a national program geared toward introducing middle school girls to computer science. It is common knowledge that the gender gap between women and men in computer science is a problem. CS Chicas believes that all girls should be exposed to computer science in their middle school years regardless of financial situations. CS Chicas brings together a network of young high school woman to reach out to mentor middle school girls at no cost to the host school or local students. Our volunteer mentors are motivated to share their coding skills and knowledge with the next generation of young girls, by passing on their coding expertise and being a role model. Many of these programs are run in partnership with the National Center for Women and Information Technology AspireIT program.
